                                        <p>❏	Team Name:</p>
                                        <p>      Our team name is CodePerfect. This name uses DudePerfect, which is a group of males that do incredible trick shots with every possible thing on YouTube. Therefore, we decided on the name because we also strive to make the most incredible codes that will produce amazing projects in the future. </p>
                                        <p>❏	Personal Information:</p>
                                        <p>      1.	My name is Ha Minh Duc. My RMIT student number is 3878911. I moved to the U.S. to pursue education in 2012 and returned to Vietnam in 2020. As a result, my culture is a mixture of the States and the motherland, but dominantly of the western side. During my time in the States, I was able to achieve two Associate Degrees for Biology and Chemistry, as I was striving to be a physician in the future. I have a few hobbies and one of them is photography. I love to capture the moments that people interact with each other, nature, etc. I do both the digital and analog formats, so that can be interesting to some people, because analog photography is rather rare nowadays. My interest in the IT field has only begun in recent years. Due to the pandemic, I was forced to postpone my education in the States and start a new path. During the process of choosing the new career, I stumbled upon IT and remembered how fascinating the field is to me. As a result, I started to watch videos of people such as William Lin and Errichto, who are always the top contestants of coding tournaments on Facebook and Google. Despite finding their whole solving process very fascinating, it can be rather overwhelming and boring at the same time since I do not understand most of the stuff. However, I think the one factor, which contributes the most to my choice of choosing IT as a career path, is a YouTube content creator, Michael Reeves. Michael Reeves makes coding look fun and enticing to me. Reeves is not an ordinary developer, who might solve coding problems and create coding tutorials, but he develops codes that create the most absolute ridiculous inventions. He once created a Roomba that screams when it pumps into anything. Through his videos, I saw that coding can be extremely fun, and it can create something that is totally meaningful to you. As mentioned, since I was a full-time medical student, I have no prior knowledge about the IT major. Therefore, I am trying my best to absorb any information that the teachers are giving my way. I also do a good amount of research, by watching tutorial videos, to improve my programming skills. I am still far behind from most of my peers so I will try my best to work hard on refining my competence in the field.</p>
                                        <p>      2.	My name is Tran Tuan Kiet. My RMIT student number is 3879300.  I have finished high school in 2020, so this is my first semester at RMIT University, and I am currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I have a lot of hobbies such as playing basketball, uploading videos on YouTube, remixing music but the reason that I enrolled for this course is because I am really interested in technology. When I was a kid, I played a lot of computer games, so from that time, I decided to become a game developer. Although games are my main motivation in studying this subject, I am also fascinated in AI, automation, cloud technology, … Moreover, I really enjoyed hacking and fixing things on the internet when I was a kid, therefore this is also the reason why I enrolled in this subject. In the past, I don’t remember the exact day it was, but I still remember when I was using my computer, it suddenly shutdown and I could not turn on the computer. At that moment, I had opened the computer case out and started to fix it, then it again and whenever it broke, I was always the one who fixed it. From those memories, I began to be fascinated in computers and hardware. Right now, I am just a newbie in technology and programming, but I hope that after I have finished all the course, I will become a professional programmer.</p>
                                        <p>      3.	My name is Nguyen Vo Thien Nhan. My RMIT student number is 3877788.I was born and have finished my high school in Vietnam before enrolling to study in RMIT’s Bachelor of Information Technology Program. Even though the first thing that make me want to learn about IT was about game programing when I heard about the story of Flappy Bird and its creator Nguyen Ha Dong, the more I learn about IT the less interested I feel about it due to my lack of creativity, I wanted to start to learning about coding and cyber security. However, since I don't have any previous experience with IT, all I can count on when studying here is how fast I can absorb the information given by teachers in order to keep up with other students. It has been about 4 months since I started at RMIT and I can think I can enjoy my school life while also improving my knowledge here.</p>
                                        <p>      4.	My name is Truong Dai Duong. My RMIT student number is 3878681. I was born in Vietnam and I have been studying here. I have finished my high school degree and currently I am studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I have many hobbies, one of my favorites is learning about new technologies. I also love searching the Internet for some information that I am curious about such as new iPhones, accessories. I still remember the day I started choosing my future career and major. Due to the existence of many new IT technologies and rapid developments in Vietnam, I have begun to grow interests in IT. I have been amazed by the IT fields because our daily life has been significantly improved due to the existence of these technologies, and these have continued to be developed and used more not only in Vietnam but also all over the world. And what’s more, I believe that IT will never be out of time. One of the technologies that I have read and interested most is mobile app and software development. In the past, I loved to watch Steve Job’s announcements about the new iPhone because he is the one who inspired me the most, the way he worked and thinked had changed the technology around the world. Even now, I am still interested in iOS software and new changes, improvements. Mobile apps and software developments are things that I also want to learn about. Mobile phones have been used widely because of their conveniences and features, and it will also help a lot if I can make some apps that can provide services to the users. In order to succeed in this field, I will have to work hard to gain knowledge and develop skills even though it may be overwhelming and challenging. But despite being under pressure, I believe that I will find joys, create something meaningful for me which can also contribute to the IT technologies and become a part of the IT community.</p>
                                        <p>❏	Group process:</p>
                                        <p>      There were things that needed to be fixed regarding our teamwork. The workload for each member was not distributed very well. The communication between members was lacking and caused traffic in the workflow of the team. If the assignment is extended, we would try to communicate to each other better to progress more efficiently. Also, we would divide the tasks better, so it is fair for every member and ensure that no one must be negatively affected due to the unequal workload. </p>
                                        <p>❏	Career plan:</p>
                                        <p>Surprisingly, everyone in this team is aiming to become software engineers. However, software engineering is still a very broad term since a software developer can also be a mobile app developer, a web developer, a software developer, etc. That also applies to all of us. We all know that we like to be involved with the making of software, but we have yet to be able to pinpoint where our main interest is. All of us are first years in the field and are still finding the best path for everyone. Eventually, as we learn more about the field of IT and its fascinating materials, our plan for future careers would slowly form and continuously become clearer throughout our Bachelor program. </p>

                                        </header>
                                        <p>1.	Topic:</p>
                                        <p>     The project that we plan to do involves creating an app that would help the population of blind, deaf, and mute people to be able to function on their own. The app would consist of 2 different features/options, one for the blind and one for the deaf-mute. Each would contain features that can specifically help each category of user to improve their everyday life.</p>
                                        <p>     First, for the blind and visually impaired people, the app would implement trained AI, machine learning, image recognition to analyze data collected through the phone’s camera. The app would be able differentiate objects, traffic signals, facial features, etc. and compile them into comprehensible descriptions to allow the users to be able to ‘see’ what they want to. Users can walk on their own with the app’s walking mode, which can be used to detect hazardous objects and traffic signals and signs to provide a safe walking session. Users can utilize the app to describe features of objects, sceneries, people that the camera detects. With continuous training of the AI, the app would constantly improve and give the users the most precise and detailed description. As a result, the number of features that can be added into the option is endless as the AI becomes more intelligent and is able to analyze more complicated subjects. The features can be executed via voice command and the assisting voice would be the phone virtual assistant (Siri, Google Assistant, etc.), which is integrated with the app to provide the best user experience. </p>
                                        <p>     Next, for the deaf-mute users, the app acts as sign language translator. With gesture recognition and AI, the app would analyze users’ gestures and translate them into precise and comprehensible verbal language. The app can also listen to what the users’ peers say and translate it back to sign languages. This allows an efficient two-way conversation for the users without any difficulty. There will be dictionaries of all the sign languages so users with different backgrounds can all use the app comfortably. </p>
                                        <p>     Overall, this app would be a tool for the users to gain back some of their lost senses and regain their independence as individuals, through the help of AI. </p>
                                        <p>2.	Motivation:</p>
                                        <p>     Despite that there is a large population of people who are visually impaired, deaf, and mute, they are often overlooked and forgotten. The market tends to only target and produce products and applications for people like us, who are fortunate to have all of our senses, to gain profit. Therefore, we would like to give back and help to improve any possible aspect of their lives. We truly think that everyone deserves the same benefits, so we are here to make that a possibility for these people. </p>
                                        <p>     Other than the drive to help the unfortunate, this project is also a chance for everyone to hone their developing skills as this is one ambitious task. This project includes multiple advanced technologies such as AI and machine learning, which is considered the future of the IT world. The project requires tedious and almost no-error-allowed execution. If we are able to successfully create the project, we would be up-to-date with state-of-the-art technology of AI and this can be a huge plus for our resume, with AI being the main attraction in the near future. With the rising demand for developers with AI knowledge, we would be the prioritized candidates for most companies.</p>
                                        <p>3.	Landscape:</p>
                                        <p>     As for goals, there are a few projects that are similar to ours. First, there is Be My Eyes, which is a free app that connects visually impaired people with volunteers through video calling for visual assistance. Despite that both projects provide help for sight, ours is much better in the sense that it operated independently and through AI. With Be My Eyes, users have to depend on the availability of helpers and network. What if there is no one that is accessible when the users need assistance? What if the users have no connection to the network? With our app, the AI is always available, and all the possible data are included during installation and is frequently updated, when there is access to the Internet. Therefore, with our project, the users would have much more independence compared to what our competitor provides. Next, for the sign language translation aspect of our project, there is one application called Hand Talk App, which can translate speech to sign language, which is displayed through a 3D human model. However, their project can only perform a 1-way translation. Despite that there are many promising projects, such as Gnosys and UNI, that have the same functions as ours, both of the projects’ status is unclear, whether they are postponed or were not able to succeed during their startup stage. So assuming if we succeed in our startup, the project would be the first of its kind. </p>

                                <div class="row">

                                        </header>
                                        <p>❏	Aims:</p>
                                        <p>      Our main aim for this project is to successfully create a mobile app that can have features that would improve the lifestyle of the targeted users (blind, deaf, mute). People with these disabilities struggle a lot with their daily lives. Although people with amputated limbs or paralyzed also tremendously struggle with their everyday routine, there are still widely available options such as state-of-the-art prosthetic limbs and transporting inventions that can restore 90% of the functionality back to the users. However, with the current medical knowledge, people with their sight, hearing, and speech do not have many available tools to improve their living. Blind people can only wait for cornea donation to restore their vision; people with hearing loss can only opt to hearing aid, but hearing aid can only help so much since it can only partially restore the users’ hearing; and people who cannot speak are stuck with either sign language, writing mediums (note, messaging) to communicate. Therefore, this app is created to provide a cheap option to help people with the disabilities. </p>
                                        <p>      First, in order to make it a useful app, one of the most essential things to achieve is the AI component of the app. AI is the core to the success of the project. The projected AI is expected to accurately analyze and produce precise descriptions of what the camera captures and what the users request. It is needed in the translation component for the deaf and mute users. Without a perfected AI, the app would not be able to carry out such complex tasks. Therefore, the technology of machine learning and AI needs to be the most prioritized part of the project. </p>
                                        <p>      Next, since this app is for people who are unfortunate to have their senses taken away, the user interface needed to be easily comprehensible and simple for the users to be able to effortlessly use it. Even for people with all of their senses available, they still struggle to use something new, such as smartphones. This is usually caused by the combination of unfamiliarity to the technology and subpar UI design of it. As a result, it is a must, to design an adequate UI to help the users navigate around the app.</p>
                                        <p>      Finally, we need to have an accurate datapool for the sign languages to provide the most precise translation for the users. To do so, we must recruit experts in sign languages to help create a database of gestures and have them take part in the training of AI to ensure the quality of the translation. The quality control of the translation is crucial, since the users’ communication skill is limited so we need to make sure that their ‘voice’ is heard correctly. </p>
                                        <p>❏	Plans and Progress:</p>
                                        <p>      Since his family loves to get involved with charities and participate in volunteer work, since a very young age, Duc has had the chance to interact with people of all circumstances. As a result, he grew a deep connection with the people and had tremendous compassion for them. Naturally, he would think of ways to better their unfortunate lives. To him, as for the poor, Duc needs a good amount of fund, which is out of his control during this age; for the amputees, there are already plenty of advanced medical and technological inventions that can support them; and with the population of people who is affected by Agent Orange, he has no capability to help them in any way. This left him with the population of blind and deaf-mute. He saw possible solutions that he can create with technology, to help them and has been compiling ideas for years. And when he has the chance to pursue IT as a career path and given the chance to execute a project, Duc is now finally able to assemble all of his cultivated thoughts and come up with Hachi. The name Hachi takes inspiration from the famous Shiba Inu Hachiko, a dog that is extremely smart and loyal to its owner, to convey that the created app would be an exceptionally dependable and helpful tool that would be with users on every step they take. When every member hears of Duc’s ideas for the project, everyone gives a nod and agrees to work on this together. That is how Hachi began.</p>
                                        <p>      Hachi is a mobile app that would provide the blind and deaf-mute more independence by giving back some of their senses. The app would have two different options: one for the blind, and one for the deaf-mute, which are optimized to provide the best experience for each category of user. First, for the blind users, the app will become their eyes, informing them of anything the phone’s camera can detect. This is possible with image recognition and AI. By implementing these technologies, the app can perform a diverse number of tasks for the users. The most essential thing that is taken from the blinds is their ability to travel confidently. With Hachi as their assistant, users can freely walk as the app can compute and detect hazardous obstacles and terrains, and notify the users of traffic signs and signals when walking. Thanks to machine learning and image recognition, AI can be trained by feeding databases of images of threats and traffic signals so that it can precisely detect them when encountered. The app can also identify human facial expression and emotion, distinguish human gestures, and recognize familiar faces. With facial recognition and gesture recognition, AI can be fed with data of all the possible facial features, gestures to be able to analyze the subjects when requested by the users. That is the most basic feature of the app, as with AI and recognition tools, the possibilities are endless. We are planning to teach the AI all the possible information available so that it can accurately distinguish everything. And with an implemented neural network, the AI would be able to describe objects more specifically, so that the users would be able visualize things much better rather than just getting a broad picture in their heads. The app would be able to describe the sceneries in front of the users, the atmosphere of the locations, correctly identify any objects and its characteristics, etc. When the option for the blind is selected, to make the experience as smooth as possible, the user would be taken to an interface where everything can be controlled by voice command. The app would implement the specific virtual assistant of each system (Siri, Google Assistant, Bixby) into the app, and any command would be replied with speech by the virtual assistants. To implement Siri, we can request for authorization to use Sirikit, which is used to implement app extensions that can be integrated with Siri; to implement Google Assistant, we can use Google’s App Actions, which allows developers to create a database of commands and add it into an existing app, to allow the users to be able to carry out their requests; for Bixby, Samsung has provided Bixby Developer Studio, which provides Bixby’s SDK and API to allow developers to implement the assistant into their apps.</p>
                                        <p>      Next, there is the option for the deaf-mute. In this option, the app would turn into a two-way translation app. Since most people of the community have to use sign language as their primary way of communication, we figured out that the best way for them to be able to function better is to allow them to be understood by people. With the app, the users can have the camera capture their sign signal gestures and they will be analyzed and translated into text or speech for people who the users converse with. To do this, we need to implement AI, gesture recognition and neural networks. First, we need to create a database of different sign languages gestures, which can be collected either from online databases or from self-collecting data from hired professional sign language interpreters. Then, we will have the AI learn gesture recognition and have fed with the sign language database. In combination with neural networks, the AI would be able to produce more complex and precise outputs. To be able to convert the text into speech, the AI would also be taught text-to-speech functions, and the speech would be carried out through the virtual assistant. Next, the users would also have the option to let the app translate back what their peers said into their default sign languages, which is conveyed through 3D hand models on the screen. For this feature, we need to apply AI, speech recognition, and neural networks. Initially, the AI is trained to perform speech-to-text to be able output text from speech. Then, since the AI has already learned how to translate from sign to text, with a neural network, the AI would be able to analyze the non-linear data and convert the collected text to signs.</p>
                                        <p>      As of now, due to the complexity of the project, the team has yet to complete anything regarding the actual app. We do not have the required knowledge to develop anything. However, we have every single detail planned out such as how the interface should look, the design of the app logo, where to obtain the needed data and technologies, etc. The only thing we lack is skill, which can be obtained gradually throughout our Bachelor program. Also, we have talked to multiple people in the industry to make sure that our plan is on the right track and what we have is proper for the project. Most of the experts judge that what we are doing and have planned is perfectly fine and correct. However, there are some concerns that we should consider. First, the app, due to its large amount of data and complexity, would take too much storage and phones’ energy, which can be a big factor for some customers. As a result, we should make two different apps, one for the blind and one for the deaf-mute, in order to downsize the app size and its toll on the CPU of the phones. This is something we will reconsider and will execute if our final product turns out to be what the professionals have predicted. There is one other common warning from the experts. With all the technologies involved, this project can be quite expensive to make, and due to the nature of it not being a profitable product and having a low success rate, our startup might have extreme difficulty in finding sponsors and investors. However, we still have hopes from non-profit organizations, since what we are doing can be a big innovation to better the public benefit.</p>
                                        <p>      With everything said, we will continue to work hard on this project. We will work hard to improve our skills as developers to reach the needed potential for the complexity of the app. </p>
                                        <p>❏	Roles:</p>
                                        <p>    1.	I, Ha Minh Duc, am the lead developer of the project. Since this project is my idea, I would have the most information regarding the subjects involving the application. Therefore, I would be able to give feedback and help my team improve their work progress. From the various group meetings, I have noticed that I am the facilitator of the group most of the time so this role fits me perfectly in this scenario. Since everyone is still new to each other, I will also be the one to encourage communication between individuals to promote a healthy teamwork environment. I will be coordinating tasks accordingly between my teammates in order to provide the best workflow for the team. And naturally, I will also take part in the coding of the application, especially in the back-end aspect, where I am the most knowledgeable of. </p>
                                        <p>    2.	I, Tran Tuan Kiet, am the front-end developer for the mobile app. I will take care of the UX/UI aspect. I have always been particularly observant of the front-end of any web or application I have interacted with. I will tend to give ratings for every UX/UI that I interact with, and study what makes each of them good or bad. As a result, I have a good grasp of what good UI/UX consists of. In addition to that, from skill evaluation, my team has decided that I have the best skills for front end tools such as JavaScript, CSS3, etc., so I should clearly take the role.</p>
                                        <p>    3.	I, Truong Dai Duong, am the security developer for the project. I will be in charge of creating a security system that can prevent any breach to my clients’ privacy. Since my brother works as a security developer for a bank, I was introduced to this area of the IT field rather early and took an interest in it. Therefore, out of everyone in the team, I have the best understanding of a security system and that’s why I am responsible for this position.</p>
                                        <p>    4.	I, Nguyen Vo Thien Nhan, am the project’s backend developer. I have been working with Python for the longest and have a good understanding of the language. Also, my overall coding skill is the best in the group so when the teammates need help with their work, I will be the advisor for them and also take part in their roles if needed. </p>

                                        <p>Although we have carefully planned our project, our project still has some limitations that we don’t have time to do it. Like our aim for creating this project, our project is created to help the disabilities people in their daily life and work. So, our project’s scope will cover all the disabilities people. Moreover, for the deaf-mute person, we planned this project to help them translate sign language into verbal and from verbal to sign language. Therefore, they can easily communicate with other normal people and can also understand what they are trying to say. It will help them a lot in their life because it can reduce misunderstandings in the conversation. For example, they want to find a way in a city, so they can use this application to help them communicate with normal people because there are only a few people who can understand the sign language. Lastly, for those who have problems with their sight and for blind people, this application will help them to recognize things and people in their life. This application will describe in detail the things that they want to know. For example, they want to know what is in front of them, this application will describe it as a wall or there are many people in front of him or her. For this function of the application, our team thinks that it might somehow help the disabilities people a lot in their daily life.</p>
                                        <p>Above is just the sum up of the functions of our project, but there are a lot of things that our team are trying to bring for the users to have a good experience in using our application. Actually, because the time for making this project is limited, we have to set the limitation of the functions down to 2 functions like what we have presented above. There are still a lot of functions that we want to import to our system such as GPS for the blind people to navigate the way from their home to their workplace. Moreover, we want to include face recognition into our application to help people with impaired sight to know who is standing in front of them. But we cannot do it because we need more time to collect information about each person and their face for the system to recognize it. In addition, we want to add danger notification into our system, it means that when the blind people are trying to cross the street, the application will notice them if it is a red light or green light or is it safe for them to cross. But our skills have not reached that level, so it is hard for us to develop this function into our system. For the deaf-mute people, we are trying to apply a text converting function into our application. For example, if they are reading a book and they want to understand it correctly, this function will help them to convert the text into the sign language for them. But again, our time is limited, therefore we just add 2 functions into our system to make it simple for the users.</p>

                                        </header>
                                        <p>   As for the app to function as it should, we will need the following tool or technology, some of which are already available now. By the time of this first report, there will be only a few parts which will play a major role in our project, there can also be some changes in the project report as its progress further. Therefore, this one may be missing a few which can assist our project. And there will be other useful tools such as many different programming languages (Python, C++, JavaScript,…) or Figma (which help us to make the user interface) but those are the one that are common between many applications therefore will not be included.</p>
                                        <p>1.     Image recognition:</p>
                                        <p>       For the apps to be able to recognize many images first we will insert into the system several images, then through machine learning or deep learning the AI will be able to recognize different images. We will also keep explaining the database for AI after the app has been released, especially during the beta-test, which will most likely be these kinds of problems that will show up due to the different interaction every tester will make every day.</p>
                                        <p>2.     Gesture recognition:</p>
                                        <p>       Just like image recognition, gesture recognition is needed in order for our group project to succeed. However, gesture recognition is on a higher level than image recognition which means we will need more time and skill to make full use of it, especially when it will have to analyze the gesture to help the user to communicate.</p>
                                        <p>3.     Neural network:</p>
                                        <p>       Due to the scale of this project, it is a must that we need a neural network for the AI to be able to learn about image or gesture recognition through self-learning, to process the amount of data we input in to identify different kind of images such as to tell if the person in front of the user is whether a man or a woman,…This one is also one of the reason which raise the difficulty level of this project.</p>
                                        <p>4.     Virtual assistant:</p>
                                        <p>       As for visual assistants, we can implement the ones that already exist such as Siri (if we can get authorization to use Sirikit), Google Assistant (by using Google’s App Action) or Bixby (by using Bixby Developer Studio). These are the ones that are available currently, therefore it is easier to implement this than to create a new one just for this project. Furthermore, since some members of our group are freshmen, we cannot say that we have enough skill to carry out this task.</p>
                                        <p>5.     Images database:</p>
                                        <p>       For the image which will help in this project, we can easily get different ones from both online and from our own experience. These images will cover most thing need to assist the user such as: traffic sign and signal, different people, common household appliances, images of some texts, or even detail about the common medicine or the one which the user need,….And because of the wide range of images needed, it is likely that we will need to search images online for this project.</p>
                                        <p>6.     Sign language database:</p>
                                        <p>       As for the data that using in communication between the deaf-mute and a normal people, we can using online databases or if possible  we would hire someone who have experience in this part to cooperate with us (for now we can not make any assumption yet about what will be happen when our project proceed in the future). After we get the database, we can then implement the AI to learn to converse from sign language to speaking language or writing text and vice versa by the help of machine learning and gesture recognition.</p>
                                        <p>7.     Speech-to-text:</p>
                                        <p>       As for the last one is about how to convert between text and speech. Even though this one may seem not as important as the previous ones, this will still have its own role: First, this with the help of image recognition might i help the blind to able to “read” what they want, or by configure this to be able to translate to sign language, we can allow user to communicate easier with deaf or mute.</p>

                                        <p>For testing how well this app will work before allowing everyone to use it. We will start for the first phase with a limited number of users and after that in public with a small scale and then we can release it without taking too many risks.</p>
                                        <p>1.      Beta-testing:</p>
                                        <p>    As for Beta-testers, we plan to randomly select 200 volunteers for this project's first test, with 100 blinds and 100 deaf-mutes. As the results given to us, we will discuss together about which part of the app needs to be adjusted. We will repeat this process for 5-10 times or until there are no longer any major issues such as lack of data or some bug which has not occurred the time we develop this app.</p>
                                        <p>2.      Introduce the product:</p>
                                        <p>    If we succeed in the beta-test, we can then release this app for the public to use. However, because of the complexity of this project, we will still have to keep track of this app and listen to the response of the users to further improve it. Also, for that reason, we can only provide this app in several selected places which will change depending on the number of people involved in this project at that time. And after we can make sure that that is working well enough, the app will be usable for everyone and that will be the end of the testing phase of our team project.</p>

                                        <p>Communication between our group members is important since it will help us to keep track of our processes and works. In that case, our group will use Messenger as the main way to communicate with each other from far away since all of us are using Facebook a lot. Another thing that we will also use to allocate tasks to each member and keep track of our project is Trello. This application will show what each member is doing and what tasks have been done. We will also provide phone numbers to each other in order to call if there are members going offline or have not seen the messages on Facebook for too long (about 4 hours). Our meetings will mainly take place at school about 2 times a week, and maybe more depending on the amount of work in that week. We choose meeting face-to-face as our main approach with the purpose of being more convenient to communicate with each other. Also, if we cannot meet at school in that week for whatever reasons, then video chatting on Messenger will be a good approach in this case. Another thing to plan is that if there are members who are missing for the following reasons:</p>
                                        <p>Coding problem: Beside the truth that this is an expensive technology, our group is having one more problem, it is about the coding section for the AI. As we are newbies and this technology is also new to us, so we don’t have any knowledge about this technology as the coding and the function of the AI. Therefore, it will affect our outcomes at the end of the project. For example, the application may not work very well, or errors may occur because the code is missing.</p>
                                        <p>Time consuming: To train an AI, we need to collect a lot of information for the AI. For example, if you want the machine to recognize an animal, you need to collect a lot of pictures about that animal, so that the machine can recognize it more accurately. Therefore, it will take us a lot of time to get enough data for the AI, because this technology is new to every member in our group. This problem does not just occur for newbies like us, but many IT professionals still find it hard to collect enough data for their project.</p>
                                        <p>Problems related to data: As we know, AI is a costly and newest technology nowadays. But there are still some drawbacks or limitations of the AI. For example, the AI cannot think by itself, the machine only does whatever you programmed it to do. Therefore, you need to carefully choose the right data to insert into the machine. If you don’t have enough data for the AI to learn, therefore it can lead to many mistakes in using the machine. For example, you want the AI to recognize a dog in front of it, but it gives the result as a cat. Moreover, lack of skilled people can also lead to this problem, especially the newbies like us. Because the AI also needs to be coded properly and correctly.</p>

                                        <p>Then we will ask for the reasons of those members and discuss in the lecture and tutorial classes or inform the situation to the lecturer if those members are also absent in classes in order to find solutions. Tasks will be reallocated if necessary.</p>

But this technology required a lot of skills in order to work with it. Therefore, my group decided to divide into 4 different sections for each member.</p>
                                        <p>•         Data collector: The first thing that every project need is data. So, there will be one member in our group who will do this job. Our project is for people with disabilities like we have said above, therefore the data that we collected will be related to disabilities. For example, for the deaf-mute, they always use sign language in order to communicate with other people. So, the picture about sign language is what we need to train our AI system to work. For people who are blind, we will design our system differently, our application will describe in detail what is in front of the camera. Therefore, the user can know what the views in front of them are. So, the job of the collector is researching and collecting as many pictures as possible in order to train our AI to describe the view correctly.</p>
                                        <p>•         Application designer: Another job that is also important to our project is designing the interface of the application. Every application or every project will need people to design the user interface. The role of the interface is to attract more customers to use the application. Therefore, this role is for those who feel familiar with C/C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, … Moreover, designing an application is also very important because it helps the user to understand or figure out the way to use the application. If the interface is too complicated, the user will feel uncomfortable or bored, so they will find other apps which are easier to use.</p>
                                        <p>•         AI/ System designer: This will be the core section of this project. It is very important because the behaviors of the application rely on how well the system is designed. So, the one who enrolls for this job must be familiar with some programming languages such as python, C/C++, R, JavaScript, … Moreover, in this section, we will import all the data of the collector into the application. He or she will also be the one to train the system to recognize things. Also, this section requires you to have a good knowledge in mathematics, algorithms especially about probability and statistics.</p>
                                        <p>•         Beta tester: This is the easiest section in this project. In this section, your job is to use our application and then write feedback for us. The feedback is about how you feel when using the app or the problems that you are facing when using it, … The feedback should be specific and detailed; therefore, our team could find out the solution to solve the problems. Also, it is important to have feedback because we can base it on updates and improve our service to all the users. So that our app can meet the requirement and make the user feel comfortable when using it.</p>

                                        </header>
                                        <p>•   Duc: In my opinion, the group project was not how I would like it to be. The team could have been more active overall. The workload for the members was unequal, which benefited some but also negatively affected the others. The team was lacking in the aspect of communication, as there were some members that shy away from the group’s discussions. The pace of the project’s progress was subpar since there were some teammates that did not complete their tasks in the expected time. Based on the GitHub commit trails, the project was finalized in a rushing manner since the whole team was affected by the poor sense of responsibility of some members. This might result in a poorly made report and website. However, there were some aspects that went well. Our group was able to come up with a very innovative idea, which still has extremely little to no competitor in the market. Despite some members not being the best teammates, surprisingly, there was no conflict between members, which is always a good sign. Overall, through this project, I was able to learn more how to work in a group with such conditions and this will help me adapt more easily and handle situations better in teams in the future.</p>
                                        <p>•   Duong: In my opinion, this is my first time working as a group in college and I am really satisfied with this experience. One of the things that went well is that all members contribute to the group’s project and there is no conflict between our group. However, there is something that we need to improve. I believe that there was a lack of communication between us because some of us, including me have not been active enough. Moreover, despite our group members finishing the tasks, some of us also didn’t submit our tasks on time which caused the latency of our group’s progress. One thing which is very surprising is that even though some members are struggling in doing their tasks, there will be other teammates to help them and give them some feedback. There are many things that I have learnt about this group. Since this is my first time forming a group so this will be a very useful experience for me to work in a group in the future. I have learnt about how to communicate between group members more fluently, receiving feedback and how to improve my work from these feedbacks. And most of all, working in a group has made me become more responsible in doing work and assessments and more active in different situations. In conclusion, I feel very happy to work with other group members. </p>
                                        <p>•   Kiet: Overall, we are nearly finished with our work. I think we have done our best and put a lot of effort in this project. The idea of this project is very brilliant and if this project is completed, I think our application will help the impaired-sights and deaf-mute in their daily life and work. About my group, there are good and bad things in my group. For the good side, I think every member has put a lot of time in doing their work. Their works are presented clearly, nicely and they make very few mistakes. On the opposite side, I don’t know if it is because we are new to this subject or we are new to each other or whatever it is, but our group is lacking in knowledge and the communication between each member is not very good. However, if we keep working together, I think we can get to know each other well and we will also improve our work too. In conclusion, I think we have done a great job, every member in our group has participated and put a lot of effort in this project.</p>
                                        <p>•   Nhan: About the group in general, I can’t say whether it is good or bad since this is my first project, I have done in RMIT. However, from my point of view, this turned out better than what I would expect for the first group project. On one hand, I didn’t think we did good when choosing the project’s idea even though it is an interesting and practical one since the skill needed for this is considerably high for a group which has first-year students and we can’t create a demo of this for the final report. On the other hand, the group did great at completing the task for this project and helped each member to have some more experience when working in a group in the future. Overall, it was a pleasure for me to be in this group.</p>
                                        <p>Whole group:</p>
                                        <p>Working as a group on this project has been an interesting experience for us. There are many things that we were able to learn and many things we need to improve on. Even though this is the first time we met each other, we were able to become friends and have discussed many ideas about the IT fields and beyond, which was helpful for our team chemistry. During the process of developing the project, all members contributed their share of tasks to complete the project as a group. However, not every member is willing to do more than what they are assigned. Due to this lack of teamwork mentality, our group was not able to efficiently complete the project in both time and quality. There was a lack of responsibility, communication, and cooperation from some members that affected the rest of the team. Despite the effort of everyone trying to communicate and giving feedback, the certain members still did not attempt to help the team. This caused an unequal share of work since the other members had to volunteer to do the parts that those teammates left out. However, surprisingly, there were no big conflicts and fights within, since the rest of the team was very calm, mature, and was willing to step up to carry the team to its finish line. Therefore, we were incredibly pleased with how our team in overall was able to smoothly go through the obstacles that we met throughout the project. If we are given more time on the project, we will definitely organize a serious meeting to be able to communicate with everyone about their roles, their responsibility as a part of the team to raise the morale and the efficiency of everyone’s work. Other than that, the forming of our group was a success. We were able to come up with an innovative idea, which is still new and has no competition in the market as of now. This is the result of how well most of us were able to work together. The individuals of the team do not have any ego, which was extremely helpful, since everyone was open for feedback and was willing to ask for help whenever there are difficulties in their tasks. In overall, we are very happy with how we were able to sort things out and created a splendid project within the given time range.</p>
