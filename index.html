                                        <p>❏	Team Name:</p>
                                        <p>      Our team name is CodePerfect. This name uses DudePerfect, which is a group of males that do incredible trick shots with every possible thing on YouTube. Therefore, we decided on the name because we also strive to make the most incredible codes that will produce amazing projects in the future. </p>
                                        <p>❏	Personal Information:</p>
                                        <p>      1.	My name is Ha Minh Duc. My RMIT student number is 3878911. I moved to the U.S. to pursue education in 2012 and returned to Vietnam in 2020. As a result, my culture is a mixture of the States and the motherland, but dominantly of the western side. During my time in the States, I was able to achieve two Associate Degrees for Biology and Chemistry, as I was striving to be a physician in the future. I have a few hobbies and one of them is photography. I love to capture the moments that people interact with each other, nature, etc. I do both the digital and analog formats, so that can be interesting to some people, because analog photography is rather rare nowadays. My interest in the IT field has only begun in recent years. Due to the pandemic, I was forced to postpone my education in the States and start a new path. During the process of choosing the new career, I stumbled upon IT and remembered how fascinating the field is to me. As a result, I started to watch videos of people such as William Lin and Errichto, who are always the top contestants of coding tournaments on Facebook and Google. Despite finding their whole solving process very fascinating, it can be rather overwhelming and boring at the same time since I do not understand most of the stuff. However, I think the one factor, which contributes the most to my choice of choosing IT as a career path, is a YouTube content creator, Michael Reeves. Michael Reeves makes coding look fun and enticing to me. Reeves is not an ordinary developer, who might solve coding problems and create coding tutorials, but he develops codes that create the most absolute ridiculous inventions. He once created a Roomba that screams when it pumps into anything. Through his videos, I saw that coding can be extremely fun, and it can create something that is totally meaningful to you. As mentioned, since I was a full-time medical student, I have no prior knowledge about the IT major. Therefore, I am trying my best to absorb any information that the teachers are giving my way. I also do a good amount of research, by watching tutorial videos, to improve my programming skills. I am still far behind from most of my peers so I will try my best to work hard on refining my competence in the field.</p>
                                        <p>      2.	My name is Tran Tuan Kiet. My RMIT student number is 3879300.  I have finished high school in 2020, so this is my first semester at RMIT University, and I am currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I have a lot of hobbies such as playing basketball, uploading videos on YouTube, remixing music but the reason that I enrolled for this course is because I am really interested in technology. When I was a kid, I played a lot of computer games, so from that time, I decided to become a game developer. Although games are my main motivation in studying this subject, I am also fascinated in AI, automation, cloud technology, … Moreover, I really enjoyed hacking and fixing things on the internet when I was a kid, therefore this is also the reason why I enrolled in this subject. In the past, I don’t remember the exact day it was, but I still remember when I was using my computer, it suddenly shutdown and I could not turn on the computer. At that moment, I had opened the computer case out and started to fix it, then it again and whenever it broke, I was always the one who fixed it. From those memories, I began to be fascinated in computers and hardware. Right now, I am just a newbie in technology and programming, but I hope that after I have finished all the course, I will become a professional programmer.</p>
                                        <p>      3.	My name is Nguyen Vo Thien Nhan. My RMIT student number is 3877788.I was born and have finished my high school in Vietnam before enrolling to study in RMIT’s Bachelor of Information Technology Program. Even though the first thing that make me want to learn about IT was about game programing when I heard about the story of Flappy Bird and its creator Nguyen Ha Dong, the more I learn about IT the less interested I feel about it due to my lack of creativity, I wanted to start to learning about coding and cyber security. However, since I don't have any previous experience with IT, all I can count on when studying here is how fast I can absorb the information given by teachers in order to keep up with other students. It has been about 4 months since I started at RMIT and I can think I can enjoy my school life while also improving my knowledge here.</p>
                                        <p>      4.	My name is Truong Dai Duong. My RMIT student number is 3878681. I was born in Vietnam and I have been studying here. I have finished my high school degree and currently I am studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I have many hobbies, one of my favorites is learning about new technologies. I also love searching the Internet for some information that I am curious about such as new iPhones, accessories. I still remember the day I started choosing my future career and major. Due to the existence of many new IT technologies and rapid developments in Vietnam, I have begun to grow interests in IT. I have been amazed by the IT fields because our daily life has been significantly improved due to the existence of these technologies, and these have continued to be developed and used more not only in Vietnam but also all over the world. And what’s more, I believe that IT will never be out of time. One of the technologies that I have read and interested most is mobile app and software development. In the past, I loved to watch Steve Job’s announcements about the new iPhone because he is the one who inspired me the most, the way he worked and thinked had changed the technology around the world. Even now, I am still interested in iOS software and new changes, improvements. Mobile apps and software developments are things that I also want to learn about. Mobile phones have been used widely because of their conveniences and features, and it will also help a lot if I can make some apps that can provide services to the users. In order to succeed in this field, I will have to work hard to gain knowledge and develop skills even though it may be overwhelming and challenging. But despite being under pressure, I believe that I will find joys, create something meaningful for me which can also contribute to the IT technologies and become a part of the IT community.</p>
                                        <p>❏	Group process:</p>
                                        <p>      There were things that needed to be fixed regarding our teamwork. The workload for each member was not distributed very well. The communication between members was lacking and caused traffic in the workflow of the team. If the assignment is extended, we would try to communicate to each other better to progress more efficiently. Also, we would divide the tasks better, so it is fair for every member and ensure that no one must be negatively affected due to the unequal workload. </p>
                                        <p>❏	Career plan:</p>
                                        <p>Surprisingly, everyone in this team is aiming to become software engineers. However, software engineering is still a very broad term since a software developer can also be a mobile app developer, a web developer, a software developer, etc. That also applies to all of us. We all know that we like to be involved with the making of software, but we have yet to be able to pinpoint where our main interest is. All of us are first years in the field and are still finding the best path for everyone. Eventually, as we learn more about the field of IT and its fascinating materials, our plan for future careers would slowly form and continuously become clearer throughout our Bachelor program. </p>

                                        </header>
                                        <p>1.	Topic:</p>
                                        <p>     The project that we plan to do involves creating an app that would help the population of blind, deaf, and mute people to be able to function on their own. The app would consist of 2 different features/options, one for the blind and one for the deaf-mute. Each would contain features that can specifically help each category of user to improve their everyday life.</p>
                                        <p>     First, for the blind and visually impaired people, the app would implement trained AI, machine learning, image recognition to analyze data collected through the phone’s camera. The app would be able differentiate objects, traffic signals, facial features, etc. and compile them into comprehensible descriptions to allow the users to be able to ‘see’ what they want to. Users can walk on their own with the app’s walking mode, which can be used to detect hazardous objects and traffic signals and signs to provide a safe walking session. Users can utilize the app to describe features of objects, sceneries, people that the camera detects. With continuous training of the AI, the app would constantly improve and give the users the most precise and detailed description. As a result, the number of features that can be added into the option is endless as the AI becomes more intelligent and is able to analyze more complicated subjects. The features can be executed via voice command and the assisting voice would be the phone virtual assistant (Siri, Google Assistant, etc.), which is integrated with the app to provide the best user experience. </p>
                                        <p>     Next, for the deaf-mute users, the app acts as sign language translator. With gesture recognition and AI, the app would analyze users’ gestures and translate them into precise and comprehensible verbal language. The app can also listen to what the users’ peers say and translate it back to sign languages. This allows an efficient two-way conversation for the users without any difficulty. There will be dictionaries of all the sign languages so users with different backgrounds can all use the app comfortably. </p>
                                        <p>     Overall, this app would be a tool for the users to gain back some of their lost senses and regain their independence as individuals, through the help of AI. </p>
                                        <p>2.	Motivation:</p>
                                        <p>     Despite that there is a large population of people who are visually impaired, deaf, and mute, they are often overlooked and forgotten. The market tends to only target and produce products and applications for people like us, who are fortunate to have all of our senses, to gain profit. Therefore, we would like to give back and help to improve any possible aspect of their lives. We truly think that everyone deserves the same benefits, so we are here to make that a possibility for these people. </p>
                                        <p>     Other than the drive to help the unfortunate, this project is also a chance for everyone to hone their developing skills as this is one ambitious task. This project includes multiple advanced technologies such as AI and machine learning, which is considered the future of the IT world. The project requires tedious and almost no-error-allowed execution. If we are able to successfully create the project, we would be up-to-date with state-of-the-art technology of AI and this can be a huge plus for our resume, with AI being the main attraction in the near future. With the rising demand for developers with AI knowledge, we would be the prioritized candidates for most companies.</p>
                                        <p>3.	Landscape:</p>
                                        <p>     As for goals, there are a few projects that are similar to ours. First, there is Be My Eyes, which is a free app that connects visually impaired people with volunteers through video calling for visual assistance. Despite that both projects provide help for sight, ours is much better in the sense that it operated independently and through AI. With Be My Eyes, users have to depend on the availability of helpers and network. What if there is no one that is accessible when the users need assistance? What if the users have no connection to the network? With our app, the AI is always available, and all the possible data are included during installation and is frequently updated, when there is access to the Internet. Therefore, with our project, the users would have much more independence compared to what our competitor provides. Next, for the sign language translation aspect of our project, there is one application called Hand Talk App, which can translate speech to sign language, which is displayed through a 3D human model. However, their project can only perform a 1-way translation. Despite that there are many promising projects, such as Gnosys and UNI, that have the same functions as ours, both of the projects’ status is unclear, whether they are postponed or were not able to succeed during their startup stage. So assuming if we succeed in our startup, the project would be the first of its kind. </p>

                                        <p>Communication between our group members is important since it will help us to keep track of our processes and works. In that case, our group will use Messenger as the main way to communicate with each other from far away since all of us are using Facebook a lot. Another thing that we will also use to allocate tasks to each member and keep track of our project is Trello. This application will show what each member is doing and what tasks have been done. We will also provide phone numbers to each other in order to call if there are members going offline or have not seen the messages on Facebook for too long (about 4 hours). Our meetings will mainly take place at school about 2 times a week, and maybe more depending on the amount of work in that week. We choose meeting face-to-face as our main approach with the purpose of being more convenient to communicate with each other. Also, if we cannot meet at school in that week for whatever reasons, then video chatting on Messenger will be a good approach in this case. Another thing to plan is that if there are members who are missing for the following reasons:</p>
                                        <p>Coding problem: Beside the truth that this is an expensive technology, our group is having one more problem, it is about the coding section for the AI. As we are newbies and this technology is also new to us, so we don’t have any knowledge about this technology as the coding and the function of the AI. Therefore, it will affect our outcomes at the end of the project. For example, the application may not work very well, or errors may occur because the code is missing.</p>
                                        <p>Time consuming: To train an AI, we need to collect a lot of information for the AI. For example, if you want the machine to recognize an animal, you need to collect a lot of pictures about that animal, so that the machine can recognize it more accurately. Therefore, it will take us a lot of time to get enough data for the AI, because this technology is new to every member in our group. This problem does not just occur for newbies like us, but many IT professionals still find it hard to collect enough data for their project.</p>
                                        <p>Problems related to data: As we know, AI is a costly and newest technology nowadays. But there are still some drawbacks or limitations of the AI. For example, the AI cannot think by itself, the machine only does whatever you programmed it to do. Therefore, you need to carefully choose the right data to insert into the machine. If you don’t have enough data for the AI to learn, therefore it can lead to many mistakes in using the machine. For example, you want the AI to recognize a dog in front of it, but it gives the result as a cat. Moreover, lack of skilled people can also lead to this problem, especially the newbies like us. Because the AI also needs to be coded properly and correctly.</p>

                                        <p>Communication between our group members is important since it will help us to keep track of our processes and works. In that case, our group will use Messenger as the main way to communicate with each other from far away since all of us are using Facebook a lot. Another thing that we will also use to allocate tasks to each member and keep track of our project is Trello. This application will show what each member is doing and what tasks have been done. We will also provide phone numbers to each other in order to call if there are members going offline or have not seen the messages on Facebook for too long (about 4 hours). Our meetings will mainly take place at school about 2 times a week, and maybe more depending on the amount of work in that week. We choose meeting face-to-face as our main approach with the purpose of being more convenient to communicate with each other. Also, if we cannot meet at school in that week for whatever reasons, then video chatting on Messenger will be a good approach in this case. Another thing to plan is that if there are members who are missing for the following reasons:</p>
                                        <p>•         No responses to messages on Messenger for one day.</p>
                                        <p>•         Not doing tasks on Trello for about 3 days.</p>
                                        <p>•         No responds to phone calls, emails, direct messages from other members.</p>
                                        <p>Then we will ask for the reasons of those members and discuss in the lecture and tutorial classes or inform the situation to the lecturer if those members are also absent in classes in order to find solutions. Tasks will be reallocated if necessary.</p>

                                        <p>AI is a new technology nowadays and many modern countries all over the world are trying to develop and manipulate this new technology into our daily life and works. But this technology required a lot of skills in order to work with it. Therefore, my group decided to divide into 4 different sections for each member.</p>
                                        <p>•         Data collector: The first thing that every project need is data. So, there will be one member in our group who will do this job. Our project is for people with disabilities like we have said above, therefore the data that we collected will be related to disabilities. For example, for the deaf-mute, they always use sign language in order to communicate with other people. So, the picture about sign language is what we need to train our AI system to work. For people who are blind, we will design our system differently, our application will describe in detail what is in front of the camera. Therefore, the user can know what the views in front of them are. So, the job of the collector is researching and collecting as many pictures as possible in order to train our AI to describe the view correctly.</p>
                                        <p>•         Application designer: Another job that is also important to our project is designing the interface of the application. Every application or every project will need people to design the user interface. The role of the interface is to attract more customers to use the application. Therefore, this role is for those who feel familiar with C/C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, … Moreover, designing an application is also very important because it helps the user to understand or figure out the way to use the application. If the interface is too complicated, the user will feel uncomfortable or bored, so they will find other apps which are easier to use.</p>
                                        <p>•         AI/ System designer: This will be the core section of this project. It is very important because the behaviors of the application rely on how well the system is designed. So, the one who enrolls for this job must be familiar with some programming languages such as python, C/C++, R, JavaScript, … Moreover, in this section, we will import all the data of the collector into the application. He or she will also be the one to train the system to recognize things. Also, this section requires you to have a good knowledge in mathematics, algorithms especially about probability and statistics.</p>
                                        <p>•         Beta tester: This is the easiest section in this project. In this section, your job is to use our application and then write feedback for us. The feedback is about how you feel when using the app or the problems that you are facing when using it, … The feedback should be specific and detailed; therefore, our team could find out the solution to solve the problems. Also, it is important to have feedback because we can base it on updates and improve our service to all the users. So that our app can meet the requirement and make the user feel comfortable when using it.</p>

                                        </header>
                                        <p>•   Duc: In my opinion, the group project was not how I would like it to be. The team could have been more active overall. The workload for the members was unequal, which benefited some but also negatively affected the others. The team was lacking in the aspect of communication, as there were some members that shy away from the group’s discussions. The pace of the project’s progress was subpar since there were some teammates that did not complete their tasks in the expected time. Based on the GitHub commit trails, the project was finalized in a rushing manner since the whole team was affected by the poor sense of responsibility of some members. This might result in a poorly made report and website. However, there were some aspects that went well. Our group was able to come up with a very innovative idea, which still has extremely little to no competitor in the market. Despite some members not being the best teammates, surprisingly, there was no conflict between members, which is always a good sign. Overall, through this project, I was able to learn more how to work in a group with such conditions and this will help me adapt more easily and handle situations better in teams in the future.</p>
                                        <p>•   Duong: In my opinion, this is my first time working as a group in college and I am really satisfied with this experience. One of the things that went well is that all members contribute to the group’s project and there is no conflict between our group. However, there is something that we need to improve. I believe that there was a lack of communication between us because some of us, including me have not been active enough. Moreover, despite our group members finishing the tasks, some of us also didn’t submit our tasks on time which caused the latency of our group’s progress. One thing which is very surprising is that even though some members are struggling in doing their tasks, there will be other teammates to help them and give them some feedback. There are many things that I have learnt about this group. Since this is my first time forming a group so this will be a very useful experience for me to work in a group in the future. I have learnt about how to communicate between group members more fluently, receiving feedback and how to improve my work from these feedbacks. And most of all, working in a group has made me become more responsible in doing work and assessments and more active in different situations. In conclusion, I feel very happy to work with other group members. </p>
                                        <p>•   Kiet: Overall, we are nearly finished with our work. I think we have done our best and put a lot of effort in this project. The idea of this project is very brilliant and if this project is completed, I think our application will help the impaired-sights and deaf-mute in their daily life and work. About my group, there are good and bad things in my group. For the good side, I think every member has put a lot of time in doing their work. Their works are presented clearly, nicely and they make very few mistakes. On the opposite side, I don’t know if it is because we are new to this subject or we are new to each other or whatever it is, but our group is lacking in knowledge and the communication between each member is not very good. However, if we keep working together, I think we can get to know each other well and we will also improve our work too. In conclusion, I think we have done a great job, every member in our group has participated and put a lot of effort in this project.</p>
                                        <p>•   Nhan: About the group in general, I can’t say whether it is good or bad since this is my first project, I have done in RMIT. However, from my point of view, this turned out better than what I would expect for the first group project. On one hand, I didn’t think we did good when choosing the project’s idea even though it is an interesting and practical one since the skill needed for this is considerably high for a group which has first-year students and we can’t create a demo of this for the final report. On the other hand, the group did great at completing the task for this project and helped each member to have some more experience when working in a group in the future. Overall, it was a pleasure for me to be in this group.</p>
                                        <p>Whole group:</p>
                                        <p>Working as a group on this project has been an interesting experience for us. There are many things that we were able to learn and many things we need to improve on. Even though this is the first time we met each other, we were able to become friends and have discussed many ideas about the IT fields and beyond, which was helpful for our team chemistry. During the process of developing the project, all members contributed their share of tasks to complete the project as a group. However, not every member is willing to do more than what they are assigned. Due to this lack of teamwork mentality, our group was not able to efficiently complete the project in both time and quality. There was a lack of responsibility, communication, and cooperation from some members that affected the rest of the team. Despite the effort of everyone trying to communicate and giving feedback, the certain members still did not attempt to help the team. This caused an unequal share of work since the other members had to volunteer to do the parts that those teammates left out. However, surprisingly, there were no big conflicts and fights within, since the rest of the team was very calm, mature, and was willing to step up to carry the team to its finish line. Therefore, we were incredibly pleased with how our team in overall was able to smoothly go through the obstacles that we met throughout the project. If we are given more time on the project, we will definitely organize a serious meeting to be able to communicate with everyone about their roles, their responsibility as a part of the team to raise the morale and the efficiency of everyone’s work. Other than that, the forming of our group was a success. We were able to come up with an innovative idea, which is still new and has no competition in the market as of now. This is the result of how well most of us were able to work together. The individuals of the team do not have any ego, which was extremely helpful, since everyone was open for feedback and was willing to ask for help whenever there are difficulties in their tasks. In overall, we are very happy with how we were able to sort things out and created a splendid project within the given time range.</p>
